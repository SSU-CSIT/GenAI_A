    "Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained on vast amounts of data to generate novel content, including text, images, and video. To generate the desired response, you should feed the input to a model as a prompt. It is important to provide a context-based, clear, and precise prompt to guide the model and get the desired output. The process of designing effective prompts to generate better and desired responses is called prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn the basics of prompt engineering and experiment with simple prompts to control how a model interprets and generates desired and coherent responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "* Design a prompt structure to write concise prompts based on requirements.\n",
    "* Write unambiguous and context-based prompts to generate the desired output.\n",
    "* Write prompts in different formats, such as questions, statements, and instructions.\n",
    "* Let's get started prompting and experimenting with foundation models."
